### Lecture 9 - Scripting and domain-specific languages

> "There is no programming language that will prevent programmers from making bad programs." - Larry Flon

- how can we write bespoke code per game object without adding complexity to engine/game code?
- how can we improve the compile time of game code? 
- how can we make it easy for the community to contribute their additions to the game without changing any source code?a

#### Interpreting vs Compiling

- Interpreting runs slower but no compilation times
- Compiled runs faster but need to compile before running


---

#### Scripting Languages

- 

Allow updating game behaviour without changes to the engine / game source code.

Allow calling engine functions from scripts.

Allow user content.


---

#### Importance of Domain-specific Languages

Typically a subset of a full programming language.

In a script:

```
spawn("door", x, y)

fire_event("...")
```
