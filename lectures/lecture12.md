### Lecture 12 - Conclusion

- A summary of the covered concepts
- Cover other things not mentioned elsewhere

---

#### Last Week Recap

- External tool integration

---

#### Toolchain

- Windows 10 + MS Visual Studio 2017+
- C++ 14+
- SDL 2
- GitHub + git

---

#### Game Engine Architecture (Unreal, Unity)

Game engine architecture is very similar to game architecture. A game essentially "lives" inside the engine.

---

#### Application Framework (Godot, FXGL)

Event bus can be used to communicate between engine subsystems.

- Event
- Dispatcher
- Handler

---

#### Entity-Component System (Overwatch, Minecraft)

Game objects are commonly represented by entities.

- Entity is a generic object.
- Component adds flavour to each entity.
- System adds behaviour to each entity.

---

#### Physics subsystem (Arx Fatalis, Sony PS3, Valve games)

- Basic game dev maths include point and vector concepts
- Collision detection adds interaction
- AABB, SAT are commonly used for collisions
- Fake Physics!

---

#### Graphics subsystem (Star Wars Jedi Academy, Metal Gear Solid 5)

- GPU programs (shaders) are _fun_ `^_^`
- Lots of interesting maths to make things look cool / aesthetically pleasing
- Interpolators rule!

---

#### Audio subsystem (Telltale games)

- Immersion
- Positional sound is easy to implement
- mp3 - music, wav - sound effects

---

#### AI subsystem (F.E.A.R, Assassin's Creed)

- Pathfinding is finding a path ... (no, really) - A*
- Behaviour trees, GOAP and state machines

---

#### Scripting and domain-specific languages (The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim)

- Using scripts we can extend a game, an engine, or anything else
- Great way to modify AAA titles (if they ship with an editor)

---

#### Achievements / gameplay (Dragon Age Inquisition)

- Numbers! Numbers! Numbers!
- Also quests, tutorials and other gameplay tricks.

---

#### External tool integration (Tiled Map Editor, 3ds Max)

- Avoids reinventing the wheel
- Increases productivity

---

#### Activity

TODO: What else do we want to cover?

---

#### Conclusion

- We have covered game engine fundamentals - a millimetre tip of the surface of the top layer of the iceberg
- You should have a general idea of how engines work and appreciate the productivity increase when using one

---

#### Next Week

- LAN MMORPG Party? :)
- Game jam? :))
- Just cancel? :'(

Your choice!
