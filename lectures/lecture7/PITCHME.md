### Lecture 7 - Graphics and Audio subsystems

> "(A picture is worth a thousand words.) An interface is worth a thousand pictures." - Ben Shneiderman

- how do game objects get drawn to the screen? 
- how do we talk to the GPU? 
- how can we abstract away the low-level complex details to simplify our representation of drawing to the screen?

---

### Audio subsystem

- how do we store sound effects and music? 
- how can we play these stored audio files? 
- how can we implement positional sound?
