#### Tutorial 1

Note: take breaks at regular intervals between tasks and talk to your peers.

1. Clone and build the assignment code. (15 mins)
1. Run / play the assignment game example and skim through the code. (15 mins)
1. Think about / choose your game engine aspect. (15 mins)
1. Discuss with your neighbour the game engine aspect you would like to build. (10 mins)
1. On your own (refine) your ideas. (10 mins)
1. Quick-fire on the spot presentations. (a few sentences per person)
1. Background research (see what you can find online about your aspect. (15 mins)
1. Make notes about your research and thoughts into a document and leave this until next week. (10 mins)

#### Tutorial 2

Note: take breaks at regular intervals between tasks and talk to your peers.

1. Create a Word (or alternative) document. Add a title page that says "Game Engine Fundamentals: MY_ENGINE_ELEMENT" and replace "MY_ENGINE_ELEMENT" appropriately.
1. Add a Table of Contents page.
1. Add another page with a few sentences related to what the chosen engine element will do. For example: "I will extend the xcube2d engine with a particle system. The system will produce visual effects in the form of moving particles...".
1. Make sure you can build and run the code that is provided as part of the assignment.
1. Consider the existing code base of the engine to see where your new code might reside.
1. Start designing (on paper) what the system will look like (visually), how it will work (architecture), what other systems it will communicate with, etc.
1. By the end of this tutorial, you should have a strong idea of what you are going to do. It is fine if you don't yet know how to implement it.

#### Tutorial 3

Note: take breaks at regular intervals between tasks and talk to your peers.

1. (Optional but recommended) Create a fork of xcube2d under your GitHub account. This is where you will be developing your assignment work. Remember to back up, **computer scientists do not lose data!**
1. Last you started reading a bit of the codebase. Now read through all of the codebase and try to memorise where the major parts, such as the main loop and input, are located.
1. Start designing (on paper) how the subsystems you designed last week are going to talk to your new subsystem.
1. By the end of this tutorial, you should be able to build, run and extend the given code. Add some code to the assignment code base, such as the one shown in the tutorial demonstration, or start a basis for your own engine subsystem.
